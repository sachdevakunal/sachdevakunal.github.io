# Welcome to Kunal's Portfolio

My name is Kunal Sachdeva, and I am a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at Mississippi State University, specializing in multiphase flows and heat transfer. I completed my Masterâ€™s in Aerospace Engineering from North Carolina State University (NCSU) in May 2025, where I developed a strong foundation in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), combustion simulations, data-driven modeling for reactive flow simulations, and high-performance computing (HPC).

My research and professional interests center on numerical modeling, high-fidelity CFD simulations, and the analysis of complex thermal-fluid systems using advanced computational methods. I am proficient in MATLAB, Python, and C/C++, and skilled in developing efficient numerical solvers, optimizing simulation workflows, and translating theoretical concepts into practical, simulation-driven engineering solutions. My work combines deep physical understanding with computational rigor to advance modeling capabilities in thermal systems, turbulence, and multiphase interactions.

I am currently seeking a **Summer 2026 internship** in the areas of **CFD, thermal engineering, multiphase flow simulation, or computational methods**, where I can apply my expertise to solve challenging problems and contribute to innovation in fluid-thermal systems.

## Let's Connect!
Feel free to reach out to discuss CFD, AI-driven modeling, or thermal management solutions.
