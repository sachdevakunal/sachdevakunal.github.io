# Welcome to Kunal's Portfolio

My name is Kunal Sachdeva, and I am a Masterâ€™s student in Mechanical Engineering at North Carolina State University, graduating in May 2025. My specialization lies in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Thermal Analysis, where I have developed a deep understanding of fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and high-performance computing (HPC).  

I am proficient in MATLAB, Python, and C/C++ programming and skilled in advanced simulation tools. My experience includes developing numerical solvers, performing high-fidelity CFD simulations, and analyzing complex engineering systems using computational methods. I am adept at solving challenging engineering problems, optimizing numerical models, and applying theoretical knowledge to practical applications in thermal simulations, turbulence modeling, and reactive flows. My approach combines deep physical understanding with computational efficiency, ensuring accurate and high-performance solutions for real-world engineering challenges.  

I am passionate about problem-solving, algorithm development, and leveraging advanced computing techniques to push the boundaries of simulation-driven engineering.  

I am actively seeking **full-time opportunities** starting in **May 2025** in roles such as **CFD Engineer, Thermal Engineer, and related positions** where I can apply my expertise in computational modeling, fluid dynamics, and heat transfer to solve challenging engineering problems.
