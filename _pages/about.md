# Welcome to Kunal's Portfolio

My name is **Kunal Sachdeva**, and I am a **Masterâ€™s student in Mechanical Engineering at North Carolina State University**, graduating in **May 2025**. My specialization lies in **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Thermal Analysis**, where I have developed a deep understanding of **fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and high-performance computing (HPC)**.

With expertise in **reactive CFD codes, numerical methods, and AI-driven modeling techniques**, I work on integrating advanced **machine learning models with high-fidelity CFD simulations** to enhance computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy.

I am passionate about **problem-solving, algorithm development, and leveraging advanced computing techniques** to push the boundaries of simulation-driven engineering.

## Let's Connect!
Feel free to reach out to discuss **CFD, AI-driven modeling, or thermal management solutions**.
