## **Project 1: Accelerating CFD Simulations with DeepONet**
**Description:**  
This project focuses on integrating Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) into **PeleLMeX**, a high-fidelity reactive CFD solver, to accelerate the reaction integration step while maintaining accuracy.

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python, TensorFlow (for DeepONet model training)  
- C++, Fortran (for integrating DeepONet into PeleLMeX)  
- High-Performance Computing (HPC)  

**Details:**  
- Developed a machine-learning model to replace computationally expensive ODE solvers for chemical kinetics.  
- Integrated the trained DeepONet model into the **PeleLMeX** code.  
- Achieved a **4-5x speed-up** in chemical reaction integration without compromising accuracy.
