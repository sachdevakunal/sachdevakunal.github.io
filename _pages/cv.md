Work experience
======
### Research Assistant – Computational Combustion & Energy Sciences Lab, NC State  
May 2024 - Present  
- Conducted MS Thesis research using PeleLMeX, a high-fidelity reactive CFD code, for large-scale HPC simulations with
AMR. Leveraged embedded boundary (EB) geometry to improve accuracy and efficiency in complex geometries.
- Utilized operator splitting in PeleLMeX to separate transport and reactions, optimizing reactive simulation performance.
- Integrated a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) into PeleLMeX to replace stiff ODE solvers for reaction integration.
- Reduced computational time and resource usage by 50% using DeepONet for reaction predictions, enhancing scalability
and performance while achieving 93% accuracy compared to benchmark CFD simulations.
- Visualized simulation outputs in ParaView and MATLAB, analyzing flow behavior and reaction dynamics in complex cases. 

### Research Assistant – Hasti Research Lab, NC State  
Jan 2024 - May 2024  
- Developed expertise in electrowetting and conducted 50+ simulations in ANSYS Fluent using the VOF-CSF method to
capture two-phase flow dynamics between the droplet and the surrounding air under 0–32 V Direct and Alternate currents.
- Programmed a User-Defined Function (UDF) in C to model the Dynamic Contact Angle at the water-air-solid interface.
- Implemented the UDF in ANSYS Fluent to dynamically adjust the droplet’s contact angle based on electrowetting forces.
- Verified simulation results against experimental data using Tecplot and MATLAB, achieving 95% accuracy, and analyzed
temporal changes in interfacial shape, contact radius, and droplet deformation with varying current magnitude and frequency. 

### Research Intern – IIT Kharagpur, India  
Feb 2022 - Jul 2022  
- Investigated Scramjet engines, focusing on aerothermal effects of transverse fuel injection in supersonic turbulent crossflow.
- Conducted 2D CFD simulations on HPC with ANSYS Fluent, generating nonuniform structured grids in Pointwise.
- Utilized Tecplot and MATLAB for post-processing, visualization, and detailed analysis of flow characteristics and trends.
- Developed a test case matrix for 13 CFD simulations, systematically varying geometry, pressure ratio, and Mach number.
- Validated results with experimental data, achieving 8% error and strong agreement in shock structures and fuel penetration.
- Analyzed variations in Sonic line angle, Separation shock angle, and fuel penetration height with changing flow parameters.
