# Development and Application of an Incompressible Navier-Stokes Solver

## **Objectives**
1. **Develop an incompressible Navier-Stokes solver** using a fractional-step method and finite difference discretization to simulate viscous fluid flows.  
2. **Validate the solver** by simulating lid-driven cavity flow and comparing velocity profiles with benchmark data to assess accuracy.  
3. **Apply the solver to simulate flow over a square obstacle** at different Reynolds numbers to analyze wake formation, vortex shedding, and flow separation.  
4. **Evaluate the solverâ€™s performance and numerical stability** by testing different boundary conditions, time-stepping methods, and solver configurations.
