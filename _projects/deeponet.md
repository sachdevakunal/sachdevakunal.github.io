# Accelerating CFD Simulations with DeepONet

## Overview
This project focuses on integrating **Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets)** into **PeleLMeX**, a high-fidelity reactive CFD solver, to accelerate the reaction integration step while maintaining accuracy.

By replacing computationally expensive **ODE solvers** with a trained DeepONet model, we achieve a significant reduction in computational cost while maintaining high accuracy.

## Problem Statement
Reactive CFD simulations involve **solving stiff ODEs** for chemical kinetics at every grid point. This process:
- Is computationally expensive.
- Becomes the main bottleneck in large-scale simulations.
- Limits real-time CFD applications.

**Solution:**  
We leverage a **DeepONet-based surrogate model** to replace the ODE solver, drastically improving computational efficiency.
