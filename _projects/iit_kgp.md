## Introduction to Supersonic Combustion and Transverse Fuel Injection  

Scramjet engines enable supersonic combustion, essential for maintaining efficiency and minimizing total pressure losses. Unlike conventional engines, scramjets rely on forward motion for air compression and require an initial boost to reach operational speeds.  

At hypersonic velocities, airflow compression occurs through oblique shock waves, forming a shock train before the combustor. Unlike ramjets, scramjets avoid a terminating normal shock, keeping the flow supersonic. The key challenge is the short air residence time (milliseconds), limiting fuel-air mixing and combustion efficiency. To address this, flameholders extend residence time and enhance mixing.  

Fuel injection strategies include:  
1. Transverse (Normal) Injection: Fuel is injected perpendicular to airflow, improving turbulence and mixing.  
2. Parallel (Strut-Based) Injection: Fuel follows the airflow direction, often stabilized by strut-based flameholders.  

This study focuses on Transverse Fuel Injection (Jet Injection in Supersonic Crossflow - JISC), analyzing shock-wave interactions, fuel-air mixing, and combustion efficiency in supersonic conditions.
