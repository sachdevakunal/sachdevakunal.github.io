## Introduction to Supersonic Combustion and Transverse Fuel Injection  

Scramjet engines enable supersonic combustion, essential for maintaining efficiency and minimizing total pressure losses. Unlike conventional engines, scramjets rely on forward motion for air compression and require an initial boost to reach operational speeds.  

At hypersonic velocities, airflow compression occurs through oblique shock waves, forming a shock train before the combustor. Unlike ramjets, scramjets avoid a terminating normal shock, keeping the flow supersonic. The key challenge is the short air residence time (milliseconds), limiting fuel-air mixing and combustion efficiency. To address this, flameholders extend residence time and enhance mixing.  

Fuel injection strategies include:  
1. Transverse (Normal) Injection: Fuel is injected perpendicular to airflow, improving turbulence and mixing.  
2. Parallel (Strut-Based) Injection: Fuel follows the airflow direction, often stabilized by strut-based flameholders.  

This study focuses on Transverse Fuel Injection (Jet Injection in Supersonic Crossflow - JISC), analyzing shock-wave interactions, fuel-air mixing, and combustion efficiency in supersonic conditions.

## Flow Structures in Transverse Injection and Jet Penetration  

When a jet is injected into a supersonic crossflow, it creates an obstruction, leading to the formation of shock waves. The most prominent is the bow shock, which forms upstream due to the sudden deceleration of the supersonic freestream. This bow shock causes boundary layer separation, generating a recirculation region where jet and boundary layer fluids mix subsonically. Below this, the sonic line forms, marking the transition to subsonic speeds, which enhances fuel-air mixing and combustion stability.  

The injected jet is typically under-expanded, meaning its exit pressure is higher than the surrounding crossflow. The jet Mach number is usually sonic, ensuring the mass flow rate remains independent of back pressure. Once injected, the jet forms a barrel shock, and at high pressure ratios, a Mach disk appears. Additionally, two upstream recirculation zones and two downstream recirculation zones develop due to flow separation and interaction with the freestream. These structures are key to efficient mixing and combustion.  

The penetration height of the jet depends on the jet-to-freestream momentum flux ratio (J), which is directly proportional to the pressure ratio of the jet to the freestream. Increasing the jet pressure enhances penetration but also strengthens the bow shock, increasing stagnation pressure losses. High stagnation pressure losses reduce combustor efficiency, requiring an optimal pressure ratio that balances jet penetration and minimal losses.
